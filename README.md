This week, I worked on the beginning states of my portfolio using core skills learned over the last 2 weeks. 

Currently there are placeholder images and blocks until real applications are developed and added to my site.

The overall structure of this portfolio consists of my name, profile image, sections about me, work, resume and contact information. I've also added basic UI that scrolls to the corresponding section when clicked on.

I've also added a responsive layout to adapt to different screensizes with rows & columns that will stack upon each other as the screens get smaller. I've also opted to have the profile image disappear on small screen sizes for additional responsiveness. 

Here is a screen recording of my site:
