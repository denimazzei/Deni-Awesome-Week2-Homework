# Deni-Portfolio-hw2-github.io

This is my coding portfolio page.

The overall structure of this portfolio consists of my name, profile image, sections about me, work, resume and contact information. I've also added basic UI that scrolls to the corresponding section when clicked on.

I've also added a responsive layout to adapt to different screensizes with rows & columns that will stack upon each other as the screens get smaller. I've also opted to have the profile image disappear on small screen sizes for additional responsiveness. 


Please also find the link to the deployed application here: https://denimazzei.github.io/Deni-Portfolio-hw2-github.io/

Below is are screenshots from the deployed page:
